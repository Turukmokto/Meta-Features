# Meta-Features

Exercise:
1. Download the archive with the datasets for the classification task or explore the OpenML site API.
2. Implement several meta-features from each group: basic, statistical, and structural.
3. Choose one dataset. Change the order of rows, columns and categories in it. Make sure the meta tags don't change as a result.
4. Choose at least three supervised learning algorithms and a learning algorithm evaluation measure (validation).
5. Plot the meta dataset. For each dataset, determine the best algorithm for it.
6. Visualize the meta dataset as a projection on a 2D plot. Use different colors for different meta classes.
7. Test several supervised learning algorithms (including the naive algorithm) on the resulting dataset.

Note:
1. Use small datasets so that step 5 doesn't take too long. But in the end, at least 300 data sets should be used.
2. If the data set is highly unbalanced at step 5, try using other algorithms or hyperparameters of learning algorithms. But you should not try to tune hyperparameters for each data set.
3. At the 7th step, the supervised learning algorithms may differ from the algorithms used at the 5th step. You can also use other hyperparameters for them.
